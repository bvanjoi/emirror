features, such as enter to get a\n          new line, ctrl-A to selection all.\n        </p>\n        <p>The default setup will provide more practical function.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>And in default EMirror, it provider following function:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            Some text mark: <strong>bold</strong>, <u>underline</u>,\n            <span> </span>\n            <i>italic</i>, <code>code</code>, <s>strike</s>,<span> </span>\n            <span data-text-bg-color=\"#faf594\">text background color</span>,\n            <span> </span>\n            <span data-text-color=\"#ba4b4b\">text color</span>...\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            And also, EMirror provider some relative markdown shortcut: for\n            example, if your input **something**, it will be transfer it to\n            <span> </span>\n            <strong>something</strong>.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Meanwhile, it also support key map, if you keydown Ctrl-b, and then\n            input, you will find the text is bold font.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            And some node, such as the order-list, bullet-list, and quote,\n            headings.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For example, you can move your cursor to the head of this line, and\n            input # and space, you will find this line become h1 tag.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>More features is under development, such as:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <p>image</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>menus</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>todo list</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>fantastic input</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n

provider\n        some examples to exhibit implementation approach.\n      </p>\n      <p>But it has a lots of things to do...</p>\n    </EMirror>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default DefaultEMirror;\n","\"use

If the set contains\n//   any mark that excludes the new mark but is not, itself, excluded\n//   by the new mark, the mark can not be added an the set. You can\n//   use the value `\"_\"` to indicate that the mark excludes all\n//   marks in the schema.\n//\n//   Defaults to only being exclusive with marks of the same type.
