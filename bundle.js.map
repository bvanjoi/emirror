features, such as enter to get a\n          new line, ctrl-A to selection all.\n        </p>\n        <p>The default setup will provide more practical function.</p>\n      </blockquote>\n      <p>And in default EMirror, it provider following function:</p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            Some text mark: <strong>bold</strong>, <u>underline</u>,\n            <span> </span>\n            <i>italic</i>, <code>code</code>, <s>strike</s>,<span> </span>\n            <span data-text-bg-color=\"#faf594\">text background color</span>,\n            <span> </span>\n            <span data-text-color=\"#ba4b4b\">text color</span>...\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            And also, EMirror provider some relative markdown shortcut: for\n            example, if your input **something**, it will be transfer it to\n            <span> </span>\n            <strong>something</strong>.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Meanwhile, it also support key map, if you keydown Ctrl-b, and then\n            input, you will find the text is bold font.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>\n            And some node, such as the order-list, bullet-list, and quote,\n            headings.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For example, you can move your cursor to the head of this line, and\n            input # and space, you will find this line become h1 tag.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n      <p>More features is under development, such as:</p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>\n          <p>image</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>menu</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>fantastic input</p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <p>More useful featuers...</p>\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>\n        And in the last, I want to say it again: the aim of EMirror is to\n        provider a struct to build modern editor easily, and it will provider\n        some examples to exhibit implementation approach.\n      </p>\n      <p>But it has a lots of things to do...</p>\n    </EMirror>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default DefaultEMirror;\n","\"use strict\";\n// this file might look strange

If the set contains\n//   any mark that excludes the new mark but is not, itself, excluded\n//   by the new mark, the mark can not be added an the set. You can\n//   use the value `\"_\"` to indicate that the mark excludes all\n//   marks in the schema.\n//\n//   Defaults to only being exclusive with marks of the same type.

Such functions will be called before any handling\n//   ProseMirror does of events fired on the editable DOM element.\n//   Contrary to the other event handling props, when returning true\n//   from such a function, you are responsible for calling\n//   `preventDefault` yourself (or not, if you want to allow the\n//   default behavior).\n//\n//   handleKeyDown:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Called when the editor receives a `keydown` event.\n//\n//   handleKeyPress:: ?(view: EditorView, event: dom.KeyboardEvent) → bool\n//   Handler for `keypress` events.\n//\n//   handleTextInput:: ?(view: EditorView, from: number, to: number, text: string) → bool\n//   Whenever the user directly input text, this handler is called\n//   before the input is applied.

A handler function may return false to\n//   indicate that it did not handle the scrolling and further\n//   handlers or the default behavior should be tried.\n//\n//   createSelectionBetween:: ?(view: EditorView, anchor: ResolvedPos, head: ResolvedPos) → ?Selection\n//   Can be used to override the way a selection is created when\n//   reading a DOM selection between the given anchor and head.\n//\n//   domParser:: ?DOMParser\n//   The [parser](#model.DOMParser) to use when reading editor changes\n//   from the DOM.

The `plain` flag will be true when\n//   the text is pasted as plain text.\n//\n//   clipboardTextParser:: ?(text: string, $context: ResolvedPos, plain: bool) → Slice\n//   A function to parse text from the clipboard into a document\n//   slice.

Should map node and mark names to constructor\n//   functions that produce a [`NodeView`](#view.NodeView) object\n//   implementing the node's display behavior. For nodes, the third\n//   argument `getPos` is a function that can be called to get the\n//   node's current position, which can be useful when creating\n//   transactions to update it. For marks, the third argument is a\n//   boolean that indicates whether the mark's content is inline.\n//\n//   `decorations` is an array of node or inline decorations that are\n//   active around the node. They are automatically drawn in the\n//   normal way, and you will usually just want to ignore this, but\n//   they can also be used as a way to provide context information to\n//   the node view without adding it to the document itself.\n//\n//   `innerDecorations` holds the decorations for the node's content.\n//   You can safely ignore this if your view has no content or a\n//   `contentDOM` property, since the editor will draw the decorations\n//   on the content. But if you, for example, want to create a nested\n//   editor with the content, it may make sense to provide it with the\n//   inner decorations.\n//\n//   clipboardSerializer:: ?DOMSerializer\n//   The DOM serializer to use when putting content onto the\n//   clipboard. If not given, the result of\n//   [`DOMSerializer.fromSchema`](#model.DOMSerializer^fromSchema)\n//   will be used.\n//\n//   clipboardTextSerializer:: ?(Slice) → string\n//   A function that will be called to get the text for the current\n//   selection when copying text to the clipboard. By default, the\n//   editor will use [`textBetween`](#model.Node.textBetween) on the\n//   selected range.\n//\n//   decorations:: ?(state: EditorState) → ?DecorationSource\n//   A set of [document decorations](#view.Decoration) to show in the\n//   view.\n//\n//   editable:: ?(state: EditorState) → bool\n//   When this returns false, the content of the view is not directly\n//   editable.\n//\n//   attributes:: ?union<Object<string>, (EditorState) → ?Object<string>>\n//   Control the DOM attributes of the editable element. May be either\n//   an object or a function going from an editor state to an object.\n//   By default, the element will get a class `\"ProseMirror\"`, and\n//   will have its `contentEditable` attribute determined by the\n//   [`editable` prop](#view.EditorProps.editable). Additional classes\n//   provided here will be added to the class. For other attributes,\n//   the value provided first (as in\n//   [`someProp`](#view.EditorView.someProp)) will be used.\n//\n//   scrollThreshold:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the distance (in pixels) between the cursor and the\n//   end of the visible viewport at which point, when scrolling the\n//   cursor into view, scrolling takes place. Defaults to 0.\n//\n//   scrollMargin:: ?union<number, {top: number, right: number, bottom: number, left: number}>\n//   Determines the extra space (in pixels) that is left above or\n//   below the cursor when it is scrolled into view.
